# Console FlashCards

A CRUD based console application that allows the user to study with flashcards. Developed using C#/.NET and SQL Server.

## Features

### SQL Server connection
- The program uses SQL Server to store and read information
- If no database exists a new one is initialized

### Console Based UI
- Most UI elements make use of the [ConsoleTableExt Library](https://github.com/minhhungit/ConsoleTableExt) to write the content in neat tables

### View
- All Ids (flashcard's and stack's) are presented to the user sequentially starting from 1.
  - If one Id's entry is deleted, the rest are updated to fill the gap.
  
### Study Sessions
- Study sessions allow the user to study a stack and all it's cards.

## Challenges
- SQL Server 
  - Setting up was tricky, for whatever reason my installation didn't install with the default parametres, so I wasted a lot of time troubleshooting.
  - Syntax - I had already worked with SQLite so the switch wasn't hard, just had to get used to it.
  - Learning to use SQL Server Management Studio - Testing queries was extremely useful and time-saving.
  
- Organization
  - I think I did a good job separating concerns from the very start.
    - I could still go further, but in projects of this scale (and that I know I don't want to expand) seems like wasted effort.

## Lessons learned
- Became familiar with SQL Server while continuining to learn SQL
- Cemented previous knowledge in C#/.NET

## Areas to improve
- Keep learning SQL
- Make better use of KanBan boards. They're a powerfull tool for organization, but I end up forgetting I have one set up, so I don't use as much as I would like.
