## FlashCard

FlashCard is a console application that allows users to select a continent and a stack of flashcards to study. Users can also view the results of past study sessions, and delete stacks of flashcards and their associated study sessions.

### Usage

Once the application is running, users will be presented with a main menu that allows them to select one of the following options:

1. Choose Continent and Study: Users can select a continent and a stack of flashcards to study. The flashcards will be presented in random order, and users will be asked to type in the answer to each question. After answering ten flashcards, users will see their score.
2. Show Past Study Sessions: Users can view the results of past study sessions, including the date of the session, the name of flashcards studied, and the user's score.
3. Delete Stack, Flashcards and Study Sessions with same ID: Users can delete a stack of flashcards and its associated study sessions.


### Adding the SQL data

Use the data in the SQL file.

1) Run a new query using the Tables. This will add two new tables for the stacks and Flashcards.

2) Run a new query using the InsertStackNames this will add new stack names for the flashcards you will create.

3) Run a new query using the AddFlashCards. This will add the flashcards to the database. 

I have not tested but think this should work.
