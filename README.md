# Flashcards

Console-based CRUD application that manages studying with flashcards. Developed using C#, SQL Server, Dapper and Spectre.Console.

## Features

<!-- - Users can input sessions manually, or track a session live via a stopwatch.
- Users are able to delete, edit and view all of their sessions.
- Users can see a report that exhibits total session count, total and average coding time.
- Incorrect input statements are gracefully handled, as to not leave users in the dark.
- Overlapping sessions are also handled by showing users the affected sessions and giving the option to delete them or cancel operation.
- Users can type "return" in any input field in order to cancel current operation.
- Goals screen, where users can set a period and the amount of hours of coding to be achieved within that period.
- SQLite database created on startup, according to .config file.
- SQL queries are protected with parameterized queries.
- Application handles loss of database.
- Option to fill database with random data, to facilitate testing the application.
- Organized code that follows OOP and DRY principles.
- All application text is organized into a static `ApplicationTexts` class to facilitate localization. -->
