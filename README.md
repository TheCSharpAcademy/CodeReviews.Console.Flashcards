# FlashCards
- Console based CRUD application to create and study flashcards
- Developed using C# and MSSQL

# Given Requirements:
- This is an application where the users will create Stacks of Flashcards.
- We should use Spectre.Console to print tables and collect inputs.
- You'll need two different tables for stacks and flashcards.
- The tables should be linked by a foreign key.
- Stacks should have an unique name.
- Every flashcard needs to be part of a stack. If a stack is deleted, the same should happen with the flashcard.
- You should use DTOs to show the flashcards to the user without the Id of the stack it belongs to.
- When showing a stack to the user, the flashcard Ids should always start with 1 without gaps between them.
- If you have 10 cards and number 5 is deleted, the table should show Ids from 1 to 9.
- After creating the flashcards functionalities, create a "Study Session" area, where the users will study the stacks.
- All study sessions should be stored, with date and score.
- The study and stack tables should be linked. If a stack is deleted, it's study sessions should be deleted.
- The project should contain a call to the study table so the users can see all their study sessions.
- This table receives insert calls upon each study session, but there shouldn't be update and delete calls to it.

# Features

* MSSQL database connection
		
- The program uses a MSSQL db conneciton to store and read information.
- If no database exists, or the correct table does not exist, they will be created when the program starts.

## Console Based UI

- This program features a text based menu and navigation system to access its function
- It utilizes the Spectre.Console library to generate the main menu and display text and sessions in the program

## CRUD DB Functions

- This program offers CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both Flashcards and Stacks
- You can create new flashcards with a question and answer
- Then each flashcard can be placed into a stack to be used in a study session
- Flashcards and stacks can be created, updated or removed as needed
- Here are screenshots from some of the various operations
