So included two SQL files, 
one to create the DB.
Make sure to edit the path where you want to store the mdf/ldf files.
Second SQL file is test data.
Just run it afterwards you created the DB and you will have some test data.

Also, need to change the PATH in appsettings.json to point to the MDF file.

Used Spectre Console for Menu / Table layout.
