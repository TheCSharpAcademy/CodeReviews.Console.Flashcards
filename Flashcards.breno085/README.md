Project built with C#, Dapper and SQL Server

- I separated the user input logic from the database connection by creating  the Controller and Repositories folders, each containing specific classes for these purposes.
- I also used the Spectre Console table to display the tables to the user
  and inserted multiple data entries at once for testing.
- I believe I have met all the requirements.
- The remaining challenge is still to be completed.
