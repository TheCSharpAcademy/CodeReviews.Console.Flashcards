## Before Running 
To get started make sure you set up the correct connection string for your local database in `app.config` file in project root. 
After that modify the included `databaseCreateScript.txt` to your specified local database file and then run the modified script.
## Packages used
As with previous projects, I used ConsoleTableExt for displaying table data such as stacks and flashcards.
